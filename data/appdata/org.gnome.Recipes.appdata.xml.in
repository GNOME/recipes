    <p>
       GNOME Recipes is an easy-to-use application that will help you to discover what to cook
       today, tomorrow, rest of the week and for your special occasions.

       Recipes comes with a collection of recipes that have been collected by GNOME contributors
       from all over the world. It also lets you store your own recipes, and share them with your
       friends.
