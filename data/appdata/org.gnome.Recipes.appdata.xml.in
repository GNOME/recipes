      <description>
        <p>
          This release fixes a serious bug in version 2.0.0, which could cause
          all ingredients to lose their amounts when editing a recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also fixed an issue where ingredients without amount would always
          get displayed with an errant '1' as amount.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow recipes to have long names</li>

          numbers in a human-friendly way and separate them into multiple units
          where appropriate. This work was done by Outreachy intern Paxana Amanda Xander.
