          This is another early release, to address problems people found with

          improvements found their way into this release as well:

          <li>Use Account portal (if available) to prepopulate user data</li>
          <li>Add a GNOME shell search provider</li>
          <li>Add several contributed recipes. Thanks, Ray and Bastian!</li>
          <li>Fix problems with the dark theme</li>
          <li>Add information about chefs to the page listing their recipes</li>
          <li>Add information about dietary restricitons to the page listing their recipes</li>
          <li>Improve the ingredient parser to recognize more units</li>
          <li>Redesign the recipe details page</li>
          <li>Fix several crashes</li>
