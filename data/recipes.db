Ingredients=1		Cucumber	Ingredients\n2	Cloves	Garlic Minced	Ingredients\n¼	cup	Extra Virgin Olive Oil	Ingredients\n18	oz	Strained Greek yogurt	Ingredients\n2	tbsp	Red wine vinegar	Ingredients\n1	pinch	Salt and pepper	Ingredients
Instructions=To prepare this traditional Greek tzatziki sauce recipe, remove the skin and the seeds of the cucumber and grate it into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and leave aside for 10 minutes.\n\n    Wrap the grated cucumber in a towel and squeeze, in order to get rid of the excess water.\n\n    Assemble the tzatziki sauce. In a bowl, add the cucumber, the minced garlic and olive oil, the yogurt, 1-2 tbsps of red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and blend, until the ingredients are combined. Store the tzatziki sauce in the fridge and always serve cold. (Alternatively, if you have a blender, pour in the olive oil and garlic and blend until combined. Then mix with the rest of the ingredients using a spoon. This will help the garlic to mix better with the rest of the ingredients).\n\n    Prepare this traditional tzatziki sauce for your friends and family and serve as a delicious dip with some warm pita breads aside, or as a sauce for Greek-style souvlaki. Enjoy!

[R_Boeuf_Bourguignon_by_primulas]
Name=Boeuf Bourguignon
Author=primulas
Description=A slightly modified version of a classic. Perfect to serve with potatoes in midwinter. 
Cuisine=European
Season=christmas
Category=entree
PrepTime=30 to 45 minutes
CookTime=45 minutes to an hour
Ingredients=150	g	Bacon	Ingredients\n2	kg	Beef	Ingredients\n500	g	Onion	Ingredients\n120	g	Tomato paste	Ingredients\n250	ml	Red wine	Ingredients\n400	ml	Broth	Ingredients\n6		Carrots	Ingredients\n300	g	Champignons	Ingredients\n2		Bay leaf	Ingredients\n1		Parsley	Ingredients\n1		Thyme	Ingredients\n1		Rosemary	Ingredients\n1		Salt and pepper	Ingredients\n1		Garlic	Ingredients
Instructions=\n\n1. Warm a stockpot or dutch oven over medium heat; add the bacon and saute until crispy and its fat has rendered, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside; increase heat to medium-high. Toss the beef in 2 tbsp of the flour plus the salt and pepper until well-coated; retain any excess flour. Add the beef pieces to the stockpot and brown until darkened and crispy, about 4 minutes per side, in batches if needed to prevent overcrowding.\n\n2. Set the beef aside once browned, then reduce heat to medium; add the onion to the stockpot and saute until softened, about 6 minutes. Add some butter, 1 tbsp at a time, if you run out of fat in the pot. Add the garlic and tomato paste, then sauté until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of flour plus any retained flour from dusting the beef; stir and toast until it emits a nutty smell, about 2 minutes.\n\n3. Add the wine, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves; stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and allow to thicken, then add the beef and any accumulated juices plus the beef bones. Add enough beef broth to nearly cover the beef. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until nearly tender, about 2 hours.\n\n4. Uncover and increase heat to medium-low. Fish out the bones with tongs and discard or rinse and use to make a batch of beef broth. Add the carrots and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes, then add the pearl onions and simmer for 5 minutes. Finally, add the mushrooms and simmer until the meat and vegetables are softened, about 10 more minutes.\n\n5. At this point the sauce should be very thick; if so, stir in the bacon, add salt and pepper to taste, then serve garnished with chopped parsley. If the sauce is thin, remove the meat and vegetables with a slotted spoon and set aside, then reduce the sauce over medium-high heat until very thick. When ready to serve, return the meat, vegetables, and bacon to the pot to warm, and salt and pepper to taste, then serve garnished with chopped parsley.\n\n** Serve with mashed or baked potatoes.\n\n
Notes=**Beef can be short ribs or boneless, as you like it.\n**If not Broth, plain Water is fine.\n**Onions can be the tiny ones, "pearl onions", or just normal ones. As long as they aren't too strong, is okay.\n**If no Champignons are available, choose a soft flavoured mushroom of some kind. In any case, they must be fresh not canned.\n

[R_Okonomiyaki__Osaka_style__by_spooky]
Name=Okonomiyaki (Osaka style)
Author=spooky
Description=Okonomiyaki: 'Okonomi' meaning "your choice", and 'yaki' meaning "fried".  This dish, as I have experienced it, is a cabbage pancake.\n\nThis recipe is vegetarian, but it is also apparently very good if you fry okonomiyaki on top of a weave of bacon. When you have finished cooking, you can also top your okonomiyaki with katsuoboshi (bonito flakes) for a fun fishy topping.
Cuisine=Japanese
Season=
Category=entree
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=Less than 15 minutes
Ingredients=45	ml	Ketchup	Simple okonomi sauce\n15	ml	Worcestershire sauce	Simple okonomi sauce\n5	ml	Soy sauce (tamari)	Simple okonomi sauce\n5	ml	Honey	Simple okonomi sauce\n2		Eggs	Ingredients\n100	g	Flour (all-purpose)	Ingredients\n160	ml	Water	Ingredients\n¼		Cabbage	Ingredients\n2		Green onions	Ingredients\n½		Onion	Ingredients\n10	ml	Chili flakes	Ingredients\n10	ml	Cracked pepper	Ingredients\n5	ml	Sea salt	Ingredients\n15	ml	Coconut oil	Ingredients\n60	ml	Japanese mayonaisse	Ingredients\n60	ml	Okonomiyaki sauce	Ingredients
Instructions=In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, and water. Whisk until batter is smooth. Mix in chili flakes, cracked pepper, and sea salt, then set aside.\n\nFinely chop 1/4 of a head of cabbage (approx. 400 ml) and add it to the batter. Grating also works too if you prefer a more uniform texture.\n\nFinely chop green onions. Set aside the dark green parts of the onion, which will be used as a garnish later. Add the chopped green onions to the batter.\n\nFinely chop half an onion and add it to the batter. Feel free to add anything else you like at this point (shredded carrots are a nice addition).\n\nFold the batter over itself using a spatula, ensuring that the chopped cabbage is evenly coated.\n\nIn a small non-stick frying pan, toast black sesame seeds on low heat for 2-5 minutes.\n\nAdd coconut oil to the pan, turn the heat up to medium. Add the batter and cabbage mixture to the pan, using a spatula to clean up the sides of the pancake.\n\n[image:3]Cook for approximately 5 to 10 minutes on each side, then transfer to a cutting board.\n\nTo make okonomiyaki sauce: combine ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, tamari soy sauce, and honey in a small bowl. Add some chili flakes or other spices to your preference.\n\n[image:2] Smother the okonomiyaki pancake with the sauce. Pipe Japanese mayonnaise on the pancake in a back-and-forth (chevron) pattern. Use a chopstick or butter knife to draw parallel lines through the sauces for a nice visual effect. Note, in the attached image, the sauces are reversed to better demonstrate the pattern.\n\n[image:0] Top the okonomiyaki with the reserved green onions.\n
Notes=For the gluten-intolerant:\n- Soy sauce is typically fermented with wheat; ensure you are using proper "tamari" soy sauce, which is fermented with soy.\n-  Rice flour makes for a fine substitute to wheat flour\n\nOther notes:\n- Simple Okonomiyaki sauce is very similar to barbecue sauce, as such barbecue sauce is a fine substitute for the sauce recipe included here.\n- Mix in other goodies such as shredded carrots, etc as you please!\n- In the third image, the sauces are reversed (mayonaisse then okonomi sauce) to better show the pattern. Either sauce works as the base, but the order in the instructions in my preference

[R_Beef_Pho_by_snwh]
Name=Beef Pho
Author=snwh
Description=Pho (or phở) is a brothy Vietnamese noodle dish usually made from beef or chicken, but it's really really worth the effort to make. While some of the ingredients may seem daunting or unusual, they're really not and they're easy to find in your local Asian market.
Cuisine=Vietnamese
Season=
Category=entree
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour

Instructions=This first step isn't necessary, but it adds dimension to your broth: place both the ginger and the onion (whole and unpeeled) on a very hot grill/bbq. Cook and turn often until the outsides of both are completely black and blistering. Place in cold water to quickly cool before you remove the peel and most of the blackened bits. \n\nPour your beef stock into a large stock pot and add all the whole herbs & spices plus the fish sauce, rock sugar and the whole onion and ginger. Bring to a rolling boil, cover and reduce the heat and let simmer for an hour or so.\n\nCook the rice vermicelli noodles as directed on the package and set aside.  Peel, halve and thinly slice the red onion. \n\nNext, very thinly slice the beef (partially freezing it beforehand will make it much easier to slice) –it's important to slice the raw meat very thin so it will cook in hot broth upon serving. Finally, chop up the pre-cooked beef.\n\nStrain the broth through a fine mesh colander, return to heat and bring to a boil.  \n\nPlace some of the cooked rice noodles and sliced beef and onion into bowls for serving. Pour the hot broth over it this –it should cook the meat very quickly.\n\nArrange the garnishes and sauces out for your diners to pick and choose for themselves. Varying which garnishes you choose will change the overall flavour of the soup, feel free to change it up on your second serving.

Name=Arroz amarillo
Author=primulas
Description=Base for many Spanish dishes like Paella and Arroz con mariscos.
Cuisine=mediterranean
Season=summer
Category=side
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=250	g	Rice	\n2	pinches	Saffron	\n500	ml	Broth	\n2		Onion	\n1		Red bell pepper	\n½		Garlic	\n3	tbsp	Tomato paste	\n		Salt and pepper	
Instructions=\n1. Prepare the saffron with the rice.  Chop bell pepper, onions and garlic, keeping them apart.\n\n2. Warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper and sauté until just softened, then stir in the onions and sauté until softened. Stir in the rice and garlic, and sauté until the rice is well-coated and starting to turn opaque, stirring constantly to prevent sticking, about 2 minutes.  Don't forget the saffron!\n\n3. Stir in broth, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer then cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the liquid has evaporated (listen for when the rice stops bubbling). Try it and if it tastes and feels about right, remove it from heat and set aside, covered and undisturbed until is done. \n\n\n-------------------------------- \n\n\n** Pour water little by little, if water is not enough, add more.  It's always better too little than too much as getting rid of water will throw spices and flavour as well. \n\n** If you use the wine/broth combo instead of just broth, add the wine first and let it simmer for a couple minutes, stirring often, before adding the broth and proceeding as directed.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n
Notes=Broth substitutes:\n1 cup of white wine, 1 cup of water.\n1 cup of white wine, 1 cup of broth.\n2 cups of water.\nRemember that parboiled rice needs more time for cooking than normal one.\nFor the Saffron always follow the instructions detailed in the package, whether is powder or strands.

[R_Bourbon_Pork_Loin_by_primulas]
Name=Bourbon Pork Loin
Author=primulas
Description=This is a modified version of a recipe found on a website.
Cuisine=american
Season=christmas
Category=entree
PrepTime=30 to 45 minutes
CookTime=45 minutes to an hour
Ingredients=½	cup	Honey	The Glaze\n50	ml	Bourbon whiskey	The Glaze\n1	tbsp	Apple Vinegar	The Glaze\n4		Onion	The Glaze\n		Oil	The Glaze\n		Salt and pepper	The Spice Cover\n		Paprika	The Spice Cover\n		Mustard	The Spice Cover\n		Thyme	The Spice Cover\n2	kg	Pork loin	The Meat\n1.5	kg	Potato	The Meat\n1		Onion	Others\n1		Green Apple	Others\n		Lard or oil	Others
Instructions=\n\n1. Combine the spice rub ingredients, and rub all over the pork. Let sit at room temperature as you preheat your oven to 110ºC.\n\n2. Place the pork on a skillet, then place in the oven and roast the pork for about 35 minutes. As the pork roasts, combine the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and simmer until dark and thickened, about 15 minutes. Set the glaze aside.\n\n3. Remove the cooked pork and set on a cutting board to rest; loosely tent with tin foil. Increase the oven temperature to 260ºC. As the oven heats, place the skillet on the stove top, and add the oil, onion, and a few sprinkles of salt; cook until the onions are softened. Be careful because once onions start to caramelize they will quickly burn. Cover the pork liberally with glaze.\n\n4. Roast a little bit more, less than 5 minutes. Let it rest and serve with smashed potatoes and vegs.\n\n\n\n** If you decide to add apples, they go at the end of the 3rd step, before dripping glaze on the meat.\n\n\n
Notes=Some use maple syrup but I prefer the taste of pure honey mixed with the flavour of pork meat.\nSame for apples; as some people add one or two. I don't like them but you if you fancy, feel free to add them.\nAlso, using lard makes this dish very heavy but using olive oil is pointless as its flavour will be missed. But if you have nothing else, use them. It won't hurt.

Instructions=Dough: Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water. Mix the flour, semolina and salt.\nIf brewer's yeast is not available, one can also use fresh yeast.\n\n[timer:00:10:00]Put the yeast-water mixture to the flour and let it swell for 10 minutes.\n\n[timer:00:15:00]Knead the dough with a kneading machine for at least 15 minutes. This is important so that the dough gets highly elastic.\n\n[timer:08:00:00]Put the yeast dough covered for at least 8 hours (better 24 hours) in the refrigerator.\n\nSauce: Peel the shallots and the garlic and chop them finely.\n\nHeat olive oil in a small pot and fry garlic and shallots shortly. Don't let them get brown.\n\n[timer:00:30:00]Add the sieved tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, oregano, salt and pepper. Let it boil slightly for 30 minutes so it gets that thick it does not run down the pizza.\n\n[timer:01:30:00]Dough: Put the dough on a floured work surface. Create balls as big as fists (each 180-200g). Cover them with a moist kitchen towel and let them rise for an other 90 minutes at room temperature.\n\nWhen you are ready to start, put the pizza stone in the oven and heat it up to [temperature:300C] (maximum temperature).\n\nTake a dough ball and form with your hands into a round flat thin piece. Don't use a rolling pin, otherwise you destroy the yeast cultures.\n\nStrew semolina on the shovel, so it can later easier slide of the shovel and put the dough piece on it.\n\nPut the pizza sauce with a spoon on it, then pizza cheese (if you don't use e.g. mozzarella) and then the other toppings of your choice.\nThe pizza cheese should be below the toppings. This way the good ingredients are better presented.\nIf you use wet toppings like pineapples or mozzarella, dry them in a sieve before.\nDon't put too much on the pizza.\n\nPut the pizza with the shovel in the oven and bake it till it is brown. Duration is depending on oven temperature.

[R_Borscht_by_sylvia]
Notes=It's easy to convert this soup in vegan or vegetarian by not adding the meat and cream.\nIt will lose a bit of personality though.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, use a canned broil as base and add around 600 g of chopped meat without bones, and follow the rest of instruccions. This way it will be ready in less than an hour.\n\nIngredients may vary. In example lemon juice instead of vinegar and ground or powder pepper instead of the peppercorns.
Name=Borscht
Author=sylvia
Description=This is a traditional soup from East and Central Europe. There are an Ukrainian/Russian and a Polish version, but both a very similar so I put them together in a general recipe.
Cuisine=European
Season=winter
Category=Soups
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour

Instructions=[image:0]Over an open flame or under a broiler, roast 1 carrot and half of the onion until charred, about 3 minutes.\n\n[timer:00:08:00,Boil bones]Boil the bones in a large stockpot filled with water for 8 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water.\n\n[timer:02:00:00,Simmer]Clean the stockpot, then return the bones to the pot along with the charred carrot and half onion and the peppercorns. Add enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 1″, about 4 quarts. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer on medium-low until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Be sure to skim any foam or fat that accumulates on the surface. Add water to replace any that evaporates.\n\n[timer:00:45:00,Bake beets]As the bones simmer, preheat the oven to [temperature:375F]. Place the beets in aluminum foil, drizzle with the olive oil, and wrap tightly. Roast until easily pierced with a fork, 45-60 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool, then slip off the skins and cut the beets into French fry-sized strips. Set aside.\n\n[image:0]When the bones are ready, strain the broth and discard the vegetables and peppercorns, then return the broth to the stockpot. Set the meaty bones aside to cool; once cool, pick apart the meat and set aside. Discard the bones or reserve for making stock.\n\n[image:0]Coarsely chop the remaining half onion and grate the other carrot. In a skillet, warm the butter on medium heat, then add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and tomato paste and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute.\n\n[timer:00:10:00,Cook]Add the sautéed onion and garlic paste to the broth, along with the beets, red wine vinegar, and grated carrot. Bring to a simmer on medium heat, then add the shredded cabbage and cubed potatoes. Return to a simmer and cook for 10 more minutes, skimming any excess fat from the surface, then stir in the meat, parsley, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, about 1/2 tsp. each.\n\n[image:0]Cover, remove from the heat, and allow to brew for 20 minutes. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and fresh dill sprinkled on top. For a more flavorful soup, allow the soup to brew overnight and reheat the next day.

Description=Mantovana cake (or Torta Mantovana in Italian) is a Tuscan classic. It is simple, yet rich and delicious. Very good for breakfast - Italian style - or as snacks, accompanied with coffee or tea. A small note; the vanilla baking powder is typical in Italy for baked sweet goods, and negates the need to add vanilla extract separately to a recipe. You are fine just using regular baking powder, but remember to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. If you can't get hold of the vanilla powdered sugar for dusting, just use the regular powdered sugar.

Description=This is a truly Malaysian dish, very typically eaten for breakfast. It is a delightful combination of boiled rice, coconut milk and pandan (screwpine leaves), eaten with the sambal (hot sauce), and accompaniments such as sliced cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs, fried dried anchovies and fried groundnuts.\nSee my recipe for Sambal Ikan Bilis (Hot Sauce with Anchovies) to complete this dish.\nIn this recipe, I outlined the steps to cook the rice on a stove. If you have a rice cooker, then you'll only have two steps; 1) Combine all ingredients in the pot of the rice cooker, and 2) Hit the "cook" button.
Cuisine=Malaysian

Instructions=Prepare the rice; rinse, soak for 30 minutes, and drain. You can also use any long-grain rice instead of basmati.\n\n[image:0]Peel the shallots, garlic and ginger, then slice them thinly.\n\n[image:1]Mix the coconut milk, water, shallots, garlic and ginger in a medium-sized pot. Tie the pandan leaves in a knot, and add it to the mixture. If you can't get a hold of pandan, use one stalk of lemongrass as a substitute. Peel the tough outer leaves, slice off the lower bulb and the upper end of the stalk that is green and woody. Crush the lower bulby end, and throw it into the mixture. Season the mixture with salt. It should taste salty enough, and a bit more.\n\nBring the mixture to a boil.\n\nWhen the mixture has come to a boil, stir in the salt and fenugreek seeds (if using), and bring it back to a gentle simmer.\n\nCover the pot and turn the heat down to low. Don't take off the lid while the rice is cooking.\n\nStart checking the rice at around 20 minutes. When done, the rice will be firm but tender, and no longer crunchy.\n\nTurn off the heat and let stand about 5-7 minutes, covered.\n\nRemove the lid, and fluff up the rice with a fork. Let it stand for a few more minutes to dry out the steam.\n\n[image:2]Serve with sambal ikan bilis (hot sauce with anchovies), sunny-side up or hard-boiled egg, sliced cucumbers.

Peek underneath and if your pizza is a little pale, you can finish on the stovetop directly over medium heat until it is as dark and crisp as you like it.

[R_Rosemary_Scalloped_Potatoes_by_erusan]
Name=Rosemary Scalloped Potatoes
Author=erusan
Description=A holiday twist on a classic American comfort food dish. Easy to make and sure to please.
Cuisine=american
Season=thanksgiving
Category=side
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour
Ingredients=5		Potato	\n1		Onion	\n1	oz	Cream cheese	\n1	cup	Half and half	\n1	cup	Parmesan cheese, grated	\n2	tbsp	Fresh rosemary	\n3		Green onions	\n1/2	tbsp	Salt	\n1/2	tsp	Pepper	\n1/2	tsp	Garlic	\n8	tbsp	Butter	
Instructions=Substitutions and conversions:\n5 potatoes = 5 cans sliced potatoes\n1 stick butter = 8 Tbsp butter\n4 cloves garlic = 1/2 tsp powdered garlic\n8 oz cream cheese = 1 pouch\n1 cup half and half = one small carton\n1 cup grated parmesan = 1 small bag\n\nPreheat oven to [temperature:350F].\n\nButter a 13x9 baking dish.\n\nInto buttered baking dish:\n- Add 5 thinly sliced (use a mandoline) russet potatoes, or 5 cans rinsed pre-sliced potatoes.\n- Salt and pepper potatoes (more will be added to creamy mixture later), stir lightly to separate slices.\n\nIn a frying pan on medium to medium-low heat:\n- Melt 1 stick of butter.\n- Add 1 chopped onion, garlic. Saute until translucent (about 5 minutes).\n- Add 8 oz cream cheese (quartered to help it melt faster).\n- When cream cheese is melted, add 1 cup half and half.\n- Add salt and pepper to taste. (Don't be afraid to use more salt than you expect — it's a large dish, and potatoes need flavoring.) Recommend 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.\n- Add finely chopped fresh rosemary and chopped green onions.\n- Add 1/2 cup grated parmesan and melt into mixture.\n\nTo bake:\n- Pour mixture over potatoes, stirring a bit to help the sauce cover everywhere. If using canned potatoes, be sure to separate the slices which are otherwise stuck together and prevent the mixture from seeping in.\n- Spread remaining cheese over top to provide a nice texture and cheese flavoring.\n- Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until liquid is bubbling and top cheese is browning.\n\nNote: Don't be afraid to use extra parmesan cheese and cream (half and half). This recipe makes just enough sauce, but extra creaminess never hurts, especially if you're using canned sliced potatoes. Garlic can be increased to taste, but be careful not to let the garlic overtake the rosemary.

Instructions=Preparation:\nCube 5 large chicken breasts (about 4 cups) into 1-1.5 inch cubes\nThinly slice 1 large onion, chopping the final quarter of the onion\nChop 2 medium tomatoes into large chunks\n\nCooking:\nIn a large pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil at medium/medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add mustard seeds and fry until they pop (cover the pot to prevent splashing). Too much heat will burn the seeds.\n\nOnce seeds have popped, turn down the heat to medium and add thinly sliced onion. Cover to retain moisture. Cook until translucent, stirring frequently. Add small amounts of water as necessary.\n\nWhile onions are cooking, blend remaining chopped onion and tomatoes to create a puree. Add water if necessary.\n\nOnce onions are translucent, increase heat to medium-high and immediately add all spices. Toast for 30 seconds until aromatic.\n\nAdd the rest of the olive oil (2 more tbsp) and tomato and onion puree from blender. Cook until raw smell of onions and tomatoes is going — up to 5 minutes.\n\nTurn down heat to medium. Add chopped chicken breast, cover, and allow to slowly cook. Add small amounts of water as necessary to achieve desired sauce consistency. (Chicken will release its own fat and water into the sauce, so wait a few minutes before adding extra.)\n\nCan be served immediately or left to marinate in curry sauce, then reheated. Serve with rice or chapati/heated flour tortilla.\n\nTo make a more full-flavored curry, try adding garam masala (ground cardamom, cloves, fennel seeds, and nutmeg), along with fresh curry leaves.

Cut another sheet of baking paper and put on top. Use a rolling pin on top of the second baking sheet to flatten the dough. Make the dough as thing as possible. Afterwards, take off the second sheet. Bring forth a knife and cut creases from horizontally and vertically to form squares (see example on the picture). Optionally decorate with extra seeds on top before inserting into the preheated oven.\nWait for the crackers to become crisp, this takes around 17 minutes. You can check if they are done by touching the crackers or by pulling up a bit in the baking sheet and see if the crackers in the middle still bends.  The crackers take on a yellow golden color when they are done.\n\nTake out the crackers and leave them on the kitchen table to cool down for a few minutes.
