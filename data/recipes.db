Description=Original pizza dough from Naples with tomato sauce on pizza stone.\nToppings are not included in the recipe.\n\nThe sauce can easily produced in bigger amounts and deep-freezed in freezer bags.
Cuisine=italian
Season=
Category=pizza
PrepTime=30 to 45 minutes
CookTime=Less than 15 minutes
Ingredients=450	g	Flour (Tipo 00)	Pizza Dough\n50	g	Durum wheat semolina	Pizza Dough\n250	ml	Water	Pizza Dough\n5	g	Brewer's yeast	Pizza Dough\n13	g	Sea salt	Pizza Dough\n425	ml	Tomatoes (sieved)	Pizza Sauce\n100	ml	Good, dry red wine	Pizza Sauce\n2		Shallots (small)	Pizza Sauce\n2		Garlic cloves	Pizza Sauce\n5	tbsp	Olive oil, extra-virgin	Pizza Sauce\n4	tbsp	Tomato paste	Pizza Sauce\n4	tbsp	Oregano	Pizza Sauce\n1	tbsp	Pepper	Pizza Sauce\n6	tbsp	Sugar	Pizza Sauce
Instructions=Dough: Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water. Mix the flour, semolina and salt.\nIf brewer's yeast is not available, one can also use fresh yeast.\n\n[timer:00:10:00]Put the yeast-water mixture to the flour and let it swell for 10 minutes.\n\n[timer:00:15:00]Knead the dough with a kneading machine for at least 15 minutes. This is important so that the dough gets highly elastic.\n\n[timer:08:00:00]Put the yeast dough covered for at least 8 hours (better 24 hours) in the refrigerator.\n\nSauce: Peel the shallots and the garlic and chop them finely.\n\nHeat olive oil in a small pot and fry garlic and shallots shortly. Don't let them get brown.\n\n[timer:00:30:00]Add the sieved tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, oregano, salt and pepper. Let it boil slightly for 30 minutes so it gets that thick it does not run down the pizza.\n\n[timer:01:30:00]Dough: Put the dough on a floured work surface. Create balls as big as fists (each 180-200g). Cover them with a moist kitchen towel and let them rise for an other 90 minutes at room temperature.\n\nWhen you are ready to start, put the pizza stone in the oven and heat it up to [temperature:300C] (maximum temperature).\n\nTake a dough ball and form with your hands into a round flat thin piece. Don't use a rolling pin, otherwise you destroy the yeast cultures.\n\nStrew semolina on the shovel, so it can later easier slide of the shovel and put the dough piece on it.\n\nPut the pizza sauce with a spoon on it, then pizza cheese (if you don't use e.g. mozzarella) and then the other toppings of your choice.\nThe pizza cheese should be below the toppings. This way the good ingredients are better presented.\nIf you use wet toppings like pineapples or mozzarella, dry them in a sieve before.\nDon't put too much on the pizza.\n\nPut the pizza with the shovel in the oven and bake it till it is brown. Duration is depending on oven temperature.

[R_Borscht_by_sylvia]
Notes=It's easy to convert this soup in vegan or vegetarian by not adding the meat and cream.\nIt will lose a bit of personality though.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, use a canned broil as base and add around 600 g of chopped meat without bones, and follow the rest of instruccions.

Name=Borscht
Author=sylvia
Description=This is a traditional soup from East and Central Europe. There are an Ukrainian/Russian and a Polish version, but both a very similar so I put them together in a general recipe.
Cuisine=European
Season=winter
Category=Soups
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour
Ingredients=1	tsp	Peppers	\n200	g	Sour cream	\n1		Oil	\n1		Garlic	\n1		Tomato paste	\n1		Vinegar	\n1		Bay leaf	\n300	g	Carrot	\n100	g	Onion	\n500	g	Beetroot	\n750	g	Potato	\n1		Green Cabbage	\n1500	g	Meat and bones	
Instructions=[image:0]Over an open flame or under a broiler, roast 1 carrot and half of the onion until charred, about 3 minutes.\n\n[timer:00:08:00,Boil bones]Boil the bones in a large stockpot filled with water for 8 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water.\n\n[timer:02:00:00,Simmer]Clean the stockpot, then return the bones to the pot along with the charred carrot and half onion and the peppercorns. Add enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 1″, about 4 quarts. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer on medium-low until the meat easily separates from the bone, about 2 hours. Be sure to skim any foam or fat that accumulates on the surface. Add water to replace any that evaporates.\n\n[timer:00:45:00,Bake beets]As the bones simmer, preheat the oven to [temperature:375F]. Place the beets in aluminum foil, drizzle with the olive oil, and wrap tightly. Roast until easily pierced with a fork, 45-60 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool, then slip off the skins and cut the beets into French fry-sized strips. Set aside.\n\n[image:0]When the bones are ready, strain the broth and discard the vegetables and peppercorns, then return the broth to the stockpot. Set the meaty bones aside to cool; once cool, pick apart the meat and set aside. Discard the bones or reserve for making stock.\n\n[image:0]Coarsely chop the remaining half onion and grate the other carrot. In a skillet, warm the butter on medium heat, then add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and tomato paste and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute.\n\n[timer:00:10:00,Cook]Add the sautéed onion and garlic paste to the broth, along with the beets, red wine vinegar, and grated carrot. Bring to a simmer on medium heat, then add the shredded cabbage and cubed potatoes. Return to a simmer and cook for 10 more minutes, skimming any excess fat from the surface, then stir in the meat, parsley, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, about 1/2 tsp. each.\n\n[image:0]Cover, remove from the heat, and allow to brew for 20 minutes. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and fresh dill sprinkled on top. For a more flavorful soup, allow the soup to brew overnight and reheat the next day.

[R_Mantovana_Cake_by_adelia]
Name=Mantovana Cake
Author=adelia
Description=Mantovana cake (or Torta Mantovana in Italian) is a Tuscan classic. It is simple, yet rich and delicious. Very good for breakfast - Italian style - or as snacks, accompanied with coffee or tea. A small note; the vanilla baking powder is typical in Italy for baked sweet goods, and negates the need to add vanilla extract separately to a recipe. You are fine just using regular baking powder, but remember to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. If you can't get hold of the vanilla powdered sugar for dusting, just use the regular powdered sugar.

[R_Nasi_Lemak__Coconut_Rice__by_adelia]
Name=Nasi Lemak (Coconut Rice)
Author=adelia
Description=This is a truly Malaysian dish, very typically eaten for breakfast. It is a delightful combination of boiled rice, coconut milk and pandan (screwpine leaves), eaten with the sambal (hot sauce), and accompaniments such as sliced cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs, fried dried anchovies and fried groundnuts.\nSee my recipe for Sambal Ikan Bilis (Hot Sauce with Anchovies) to complete this dish.\nIn this recipe, I outlined the steps to cook the rice on a stove. If you have a rice cooker, then you'll only have two steps; 1) Combine all ingredients in the pot of the rice cooker, and 2) Hit the "cook" button.
Cuisine=Malaysian
Season=
Category=breakfast
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=30 to 45 minutes
Ingredients=2.5	cup	Basmati rice	\n1	cup	Coconut milk	\n1.5	cup	Water	\n6		Shallots	\n3		Garlic	\n2	cm	Ginger	\n2		Pandan leaves	\n1		Salt	\n1	tsp	Fenugreek seeds (optional)	
Instructions=Prepare the rice; rinse, soak for 30 minutes, and drain. You can also use any long-grain rice instead of basmati.\n\n[image:0]Peel the shallots, garlic and ginger, then slice them thinly.\n\n[image:1]Mix the coconut milk, water, shallots, garlic and ginger in a medium-sized pot. Tie the pandan leaves in a knot, and add it to the mixture. If you can't get a hold of pandan, use one stalk of lemongrass as a substitute. Peel the tough outer leaves, slice off the lower bulb and the upper end of the stalk that is green and woody. Crush the lower bulby end, and throw it into the mixture. Season the mixture with salt. It should taste salty enough, and a bit more.\n\nBring the mixture to a boil.\n\nWhen the mixture has come to a boil, stir in the salt and fenugreek seeds (if using), and bring it back to a gentle simmer.\n\nCover the pot and turn the heat down to low. Don't take off the lid while the rice is cooking.\n\nStart checking the rice at around 20 minutes. When done, the rice will be firm but tender, and no longer crunchy.\n\nTurn off the heat and let stand about 5-7 minutes, covered.\n\nRemove the lid, and fluff up the rice with a fork. Let it stand for a few more minutes to dry out the steam.\n\n[image:2]Serve with sambal ikan bilis (hot sauce with anchovies), sunny-side up or hard-boiled egg, sliced cucumbers.

Description=A holiday twist on a classic American comfort food dish. Easy to make and sure to please.
Cuisine=american

Category=side
PrepTime=15 to 30 minutes
CookTime=More than an hour
Ingredients=5		Potato	\n1		Onion	\n1	oz	Cream cheese	\n1	cup	Half and half	\n1	cup	Parmesan cheese, grated	\n2	tbsp	Fresh rosemary	\n3		Green onions	\n1/2	tbsp	Salt	\n1/2	tsp	Pepper	\n1/2	tsp	Garlic	\n8	tbsp	Butter	
Instructions=Substitutions and conversions:\n5 potatoes = 5 cans sliced potatoes\n1 stick butter = 8 Tbsp butter\n4 cloves garlic = 1/2 tsp powdered garlic\n8 oz cream cheese = 1 pouch\n1 cup half and half = one small carton\n1 cup grated parmesan = 1 small bag\n\nPreheat oven to [temperature:350F].\n\nButter a 13x9 baking dish.\n\nInto buttered baking dish:\n- Add 5 thinly sliced (use a mandoline) russet potatoes, or 5 cans rinsed pre-sliced potatoes.\n- Salt and pepper potatoes (more will be added to creamy mixture later), stir lightly to separate slices.\n\nIn a frying pan on medium to medium-low heat:\n- Melt 1 stick of butter.\n- Add 1 chopped onion, garlic. Saute until translucent (about 5 minutes).\n- Add 8 oz cream cheese (quartered to help it melt faster).\n- When cream cheese is melted, add 1 cup half and half.\n- Add salt and pepper to taste. (Don't be afraid to use more salt than you expect — it's a large dish, and potatoes need flavoring.) Recommend 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.\n- Add finely chopped fresh rosemary and chopped green onions.\n- Add 1/2 cup grated parmesan and melt into mixture.\n\nTo bake:\n- Pour mixture over potatoes, stirring a bit to help the sauce cover everywhere. If using canned potatoes, be sure to separate the slices which are otherwise stuck together and prevent the mixture from seeping in.\n- Spread remaining cheese over top to provide a nice texture and cheese flavoring.\n- Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until liquid is bubbling and top cheese is browning.\n\nNote: Don't be afraid to use extra parmesan cheese and cream (half and half). This recipe makes just enough sauce, but extra creaminess never hurts, especially if you're using canned sliced potatoes. Garlic can be increased to taste, but be careful not to let the garlic overtake the rosemary.

Name=Traditional South Indian Tomato Chicken Curry, Fast Version
Author=erusan
Description=A quick and easy version of a traditional South Indian chicken curry dish, learned from a Mallu immigrant and cook.
Cuisine=indian
Season=
Category=entree
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=1	tbsp	Mustard seeds	\n1	tbsp	Garlic powder	\n2	tsp	Tumeric ground	\n1/2	tbsp	Coriander	\n1/2	tsp	Cumin	\n1/2	tsp	Ginger ground	\n1/4	tsp	Cinnamon	\n1	tsp	Salt	\n1	tsp	Pepper	\n3	tbsp	Olive oil, extra-virgin	\n5		Chicken breasts, large	\n1		Onion, large	\n2		Tomatoes, medium	\n2	cup	Rice	
Instructions=Preparation:\nCube 5 large chicken breasts (about 4 cups) into 1-1.5 inch cubes\nThinly slice 1 large onion, chopping the final quarter of the onion\nChop 2 medium tomatoes into large chunks\n\nCooking:\nIn a large pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil at medium/medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add mustard seeds and fry until they pop (cover the pot to prevent splashing). Too much heat will burn the seeds.\n\nOnce seeds have popped, turn down the heat to medium and add thinly sliced onion. Cover to retain moisture. Cook until translucent, stirring frequently. Add small amounts of water as necessary.\n\nWhile onions are cooking, blend remaining chopped onion and tomatoes to create a puree. Add water if necessary.\n\nOnce onions are translucent, increase heat to medium-high and immediately add all spices. Toast for 30 seconds until aromatic.\n\nAdd the rest of the olive oil (2 more tbsp) and tomato and onion puree from blender. Cook until raw smell of onions and tomatoes is going — up to 5 minutes.\n\nTurn down heat to medium. Add chopped chicken breast, cover, and allow to slowly cook. Add small amounts of water as necessary to achieve desired sauce consistency. (Chicken will release its own fat and water into the sauce, so wait a few minutes before adding extra.)\n\nCan be served immediately or left to marinate in curry sauce, then reheated. Serve with rice or chapati/heated flour tortilla.\n\nTo make a more full-flavored curry, try adding garam masala (ground cardamom, cloves, fennel seeds, and nutmeg), along with fresh curry leaves.

[R_Wholesome_Crackers_by_bastian]
Name=Wholesome Crackers
Author=bastian
Description=Crackers are a fulfilling alternative snack and keeps your stomach going. Crackers consist of seeds, oat and flour. The recipe described here is very flexible. You can use whichever seeds, nuts and flour types you may have. I've personally tried almonds, sesame seeds, chia seeds, rye grains, millet and  buckwheat.
Cuisine=nordic
Season=winter
Category=snacks
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=3 1/2	dl	Flour	\n1	dl	Oatmeal	\n1	dl	Linseeds	\n1	dl	Sunflower seeds	\n1	dl	Pumpkin seeds	\n1	tsp	Baking powder	\n2	tsp	Salt	\n1 1/2	dl	Water	\n1/2	dl	Oil	
Instructions=Turn on the oven at [temperature:200C]. Mix all dry ingredients (seeds, flour, oatmeal, baking powder and salt) together. Mix oil. Then add water gradually while mixing until the dough is firm and pasty. If you add too much water, the dough will end up sticking too much to the baking paper.\n\nCut a sheet of baking paper at the size of a baking tray and place the dough on it. Cut another sheet of baking paper and put on top. Use a rolling pin on top of the second baking sheet to flatten the dough. Make the dough as thing as possible. Afterwards, take off the second sheet. Bring forth a knife and cut creases from horizontally and vertically to form squares (see example on the picture). Optionally decorate with extra seeds on top before inserting into the preheated oven.\nWait for the crackers to become crisp, this takes around 17 minutes. You can check if they are done by touching the crackers or by pulling up a bit in the baking sheet and see if the crackers in the middle still bends.  The crackers take on a yellow golden color when they are done.\n\nTake out the crackers and leave them on the kitchen table to cool down for a few minutes.
