Description=A quick and easy version of a traditional South Indian chicken curry dish, learned from a Mallu immigrant and cook.
Cuisine=indian
Season=
Category=entree
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=1\ttbsp\tMustard seeds\t\n1\ttbsp\tGarlic powder\t\n2\ttsp\tTumeric ground\t\n1/2\ttbsp\tCoriander\t\n1/2\ttsp\tCumin\t\n1/2\ttsp\tGinger ground\t\n1/4\ttsp\tCinnamon\t\n1\ttsp\tSalt\t\n1\ttsp\tPepper\t\n3\ttbsp\tOlive oil, extra-virgin\t\n5\t\tChicken breasts, large\t\n1\t\tOnion, large\t\n2\t\tTomatoes, medium\t\n2\tcup\tRice\t
Instructions=Preparation:\nCube 5 large chicken breasts (about 4 cups) into 1-1.5 inch cubes\nThinly slice 1 large onion, chopping the final quarter of the onion\nChop 2 medium tomatoes into large chunks\n\nCooking:\nIn a large pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil at medium/medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add mustard seeds and fry until they pop (cover the pot to prevent splashing). Too much heat will burn the seeds.\n\nOnce seeds have popped, turn down the heat to medium and add thinly sliced onion. Cover to retain moisture. Cook until translucent, stirring frequently. Add small amounts of water as necessary.\n\nWhile onions are cooking, blend remaining chopped onion and tomatoes to create a puree. Add water if necessary.\n\nOnce onions are translucent, increase heat to medium-high and immediately add all spices. Toast for 30 seconds until aromatic.\n\nAdd the rest of the olive oil (2 more tbsp) and tomato and onion puree from blender. Cook until raw smell of onions and tomatoes is going — up to 5 minutes.\n\nTurn down heat to medium. Add chopped chicken breast, cover, and allow to slowly cook. Add small amounts of water as necessary to achieve desired sauce consistency. (Chicken will release its own fat and water into the sauce, so wait a few minutes before adding extra.)\n\nCan be served immediately or left to marinate in curry sauce, then reheated. Serve with rice or chapati/heated flour tortilla.\n\nTo make a more full-flavored curry, try adding garam masala (ground cardamom, cloves, fennel seeds, and nutmeg), along with fresh curry leaves.

Instructions=Substitutions and conversions:\n5 potatoes = 5 cans sliced potatoes\n1 stick butter = 8 Tbsp butter\n4 cloves garlic = 1/2 tsp powdered garlic\n8 oz cream cheese = 1 pouch\n1 cup half and half = one small carton\n1 cup grated parmesan = 1 small bag\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F.\n\nButter a 13x9 baking dish.\n\nInto buttered baking dish:\n- Add 5 thinly sliced (use a mandoline) russet potatoes, or 5 cans rinsed pre-sliced potatoes.\n- Salt and pepper potatoes (more will be added to creamy mixture later), stir lightly to separate slices.\n\nIn a frying pan on medium to medium-low heat:\n- Melt 1 stick of butter.\n- Add 1 chopped onion, garlic. Saute until translucent (about 5 minutes).\n- Add 8 oz cream cheese (quartered to help it melt faster).\n- When cream cheese is melted, add 1 cup half and half.\n- Add salt and pepper to taste. (Don't be afraid to use more salt than you expect — it's a large dish, and potatoes need flavoring.) Recommend 1/2 Tbsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.\n- Add finely chopped fresh rosemary and chopped green onions.\n- Add 1/2 cup grated parmesan and melt into mixture.\n\nTo bake:\n- Pour mixture over potatoes, stirring a bit to help the sauce cover everywhere. If using canned potatoes, be sure to separate the slices which are otherwise stuck together and prevent the mixture from seeping in.\n- Spread remaining cheese over top to provide a nice texture and cheese flavoring.\n- Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until liquid is bubbling and top cheese is browning.\n\nNote: Don't be afraid to use extra parmesan cheese and cream (half and half). This recipe makes just enough sauce, but extra creaminess never hurts, especially if you're using canned sliced potatoes. Garlic can be increased to taste, but be careful not to let the garlic overtake the rosemary.

Cover in plastic, and let it sit for another couple of hours without touching it.\n\nThe dough should have spread on it own (takes about 2 hours). Lift the sides of the dough to let big air bubbles out.\n\nPut in the oven at 280°C. (or as hot as your oven goes) for about 15 minutes. Peek underneath and if your pizza is a little pale, you can finish on the stovetop directly over medium heat until it is as dark and crisp as you like it.

[R_Wholesome_Crackers_by_bastian]
Name=Wholesome Crackers
Author=bastian
Description=Crackers are a fulfilling alternative snack and keeps your stomach going. Crackers consist of seeds, oat and flour. The recipe described here is very flexible. You can use whichever seeds, nuts and flour types you may have. I've personally tried almonds, sesame seeds, chia seeds, rye grains, millet and  buckwheat.
Cuisine=Nordic
Season=winter
Category=snacks
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=3 1/2	dl	Flour	\n1	dl	Oatmeal	\n1	dl	Linseeds	\n1	dl	Sunflower seeds	\n1	dl	Pumpkin seeds	\n1	tsp	Baking powder	\n2	tsp	Salt	\n1 1/2	dl	Water	\n1/2	dl	Oil	
Instructions=Turn on the oven at 473,15 K (200 °C). Mix all dry ingredients (seeds, flour, oatmeal, baking powder and salt) together. Mix oil. Then add water gradually while mixing until the dough is firm and pasty. If you add too much water, the dough will end up sticking too much to the baking paper.\n\nCut a sheet of baking paper at the size of a baking tray and place the dough on it. Cut another sheet of baking paper and put on top. Use a rolling pin on top of the second baking sheet to flatten the dough. Make the dough as thing as possible. Afterwards, take off the second sheet. Bring forth a knife and cut creases from horizontally and vertically to form squares (see example on the picture). Optionally decorate with extra seeds on top before inserting into the preheated oven.\nWait for the crackers to become crisp, this takes around 17 minutes. You can check if they are done by touching the crackers or by pulling up a bit in the baking sheet and see if the crackers in the middle still bends.  The crackers take on a yellow golden color when they are done.\n\nTake out the crackers and leave them on the kitchen table to cool down for a few minutes.

[R_Gingered_Carrot_Soup_by_mwleeds]
Name=Gingered Carrot Soup
Author=mwleeds
Description=A nutritious vegan soup that can be made relatively quickly
Cuisine=
Season=winter
Category=entree
PrepTime=Less than 15 minutes
CookTime=15 to 30 minutes
Ingredients=2	lb	Carrot	\n4	cup	Water	\n1	tbsp	Olive oil, extra-virgin	\n1 ½	cup	Onion	\n2	tsp	Garlic	\n2	tbsp	Ginger, freshly grated	\n1	tsp	Salt	\n¼	tsp	Cumin	\n¼	tsp	Ground fennel	\n¼	tsp	Cinnamon	\n3	tbsp	Lemon juice	\n1	cup	Cashews, lightly toasted	
Instructions=Place carrots in large saucepan with water, cover, bring to a boil. Lower heat, simmer until very tender (10-15 minutes). While carrots are cooking, saute in olive oil all the onions, 5 minutes, then add garlic, ginger, salt, and spices. When all is well mingled, stir in lemon juice. Use food processor or blender to puree everything together (including all the toasted cashews). If you like a more textured soup, only half puree.\n\nGarnish with parsley, chives, mint or scallions if you want. Top with cayenne pepper if you want a spicier soup. You can also add any leftover grains like rice, barley, couscous, etc. at the last minute.\n\nThis is my Aunt Wendy's recipe.
