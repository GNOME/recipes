  <title>Add Cooking Directions</title>
  <p>Press the <gui>New Recipe</gui> in the upper left corner of 
    <app>Recipes</app>.  In the Directions text box, type the steps needed 
    to create the recipe.  To separate each step, press <key>Enter</key> twice 
    to create a new paragraph for each step.  <app>Recipes</app>
    will automatically create separate steps for your
    recipe.  These steps will be used when it is time to cook using
    full screen mode in <app>Recipes</app>.</p>
  <p>In each paragraph for each step, you can include the following tags
    for adding images, timers or temperature.  You can only use an image
    or a timer, but not both in a given step.
    The information in these tags will be available when viewing the recipe
    or when in hands-free mode.  All tags are enclosed within brackets.</p>

        <title>Timers</title>        
          <p>To create a timer, enter how long the timer should be within
          brackets.  An example of a one minute and thirty second timer 
          would be: <cmd>[01:30]</cmd>.
          </p>
          <p>You can add a description for the timer by adding a comma 
          and the description. An example of a fifteen minute timer to 
          preheat the oven would be: <cmd>[15:00,Preheat oven]</cmd>.

        <title>Images</title>
          <p>You can add an image or photo of the finished recipe and also
          a photo of each each step of making a recipe.  See

          images to your recipe.

              each photo you have added will be displayed.    The first image
              would be number one, the second would be number two and so on.
