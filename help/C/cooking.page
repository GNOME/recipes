  <title>Start Cooking</title>
  
  <p><app>Recipes</app> features a hands-free mode to help you with recipe
  directions when you want to cook a recipe.  Hands-free mode makes it
  easy to view the steps to make a recipe, including starting timers 
  or seeing photos of each step, if they were included in the recipe.</p>
  
  <p>To start cooking with hands-free mode:</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the recipe you want to cook.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press the <gui>Start Cooking</gui> button in the top right corner.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p><app>Recipes</app> will change to full screen mode, also known as 
      hands-free mode and display the first step to cook the recipe.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To move to the next step of the recipe, press any key on the
      keyboard.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To move to the previous step, press the left arrow key on the
      keyboard.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To start a timer, press the <gui>Start</gui> button or 
      <key>Spacebar</key>.  Once you have
      started a timer, you can press <gui>Pause</gui> to pause the timer
      or <gui>Reset</gui> to re-start the timer from the beginning. You can
      have multiple timers running and the names of the step associated
      with each timer will be shown in the upper left corner of 
      <app>Recipes</app>.  When the timer is done, your computer
      will beep and <gui>Time is up!</gui> will be shown.
      </p>
      <p>When a timer is running, the name of the timer will be shown
      in the upper left corner of hands-free mode.  You can move to the next
      steps while a timer is running.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To move to the next step of the recipe, press any key on the
      keyboard.
      </p>
