  <title>Printing and Sharing</title>
  
  <p>You can email a shopping list or recipe to a friend.  Shopping lists
  will email all of the ingredients needed in the body of an email.  If you
  email a recipe, the email recipient will receive the recipe as an email
  attachment.  They can download the attachment and double-click it to import
  the recipe you shared into <app>Recipes</app>.</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the recipe or shopping list you want to email.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press the <gui>Share</gui> button.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If you would like to share multiple recipes, press the <gui>Add More</gui>
      button in the top-right window and open another recipe and then press 
      <gui>Share</gui> again.
      </p>

      shopping list or the recipe as an attachment and the <em>Subject</em> 
      line and email body will be automatically filled out for you.
