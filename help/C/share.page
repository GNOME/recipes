  <title>Share a Recipe or Shopping List Using Email</title>
  <p>You can email a shopping list or recipe to a friend.  Shopping lists
  will email all of the ingredients needed in the body of an email.  If you
  email a recipe, the email recipient will receive the recipe as an email
  attachment.  They can download the attachment and double-click it to import
  the recipe you shared into <app>Recipes</app>.</p>
  
  <note><p>You must use an email application to share recipes.  Web based
      email, like Gmail or Yahoo!, will not work to share recipes.</p>
  </note>

      line and email body will be automatically filled out for you.
      If you are emailing a shopping list, the shopping list will be included
      in the body of the email.  If you are sharing a recipe, the recipe will
      be attached to the email.
